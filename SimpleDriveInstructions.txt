Starting a robot program from scratch.
The goal is to get the robot to move.
We will us 2 or 3 "sleds" to test.

1. Open VS Code
2. Click the small WPI logo in the top right of your window
3. Select the "Create a new project" (you might have to search for it by typing creat...)
4. Select a "Project template", "Project Language" (C++), "A Project Base" (TimedRobot), "Project Folder" (C:\Users\???\Documents\VSCode_Workspace), "Project Name (SimpleDrive)"
5. Click "Generate Project", select "Yes (Current Window)"
6. If not in template, add Robot.h and Robot.cpp files
7. Add library includes
8. Add code (this will take a while; look at the links below; the mentors will help, but try to dig in to the available documents first)
9. Get it to build (click the ellipsis button to the right of the WPI button and choose Build Robot Code; you can also use the command palette; Ctrl+Shift+P will open the command palette)
10. Connect to a robot WiFi (networks are named like 1259_1 or 1259_5)
11. Deploy your code to the robot (ellipsis button, choose Deploy Robot Code)
12. Conenct the USB XBox controller
13. Open the driver station
14. Announce loudly "ENABLE" (I wanna hear it)
15. Click the enable button
16. If all went well, the robot should be drivable
